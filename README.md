Horizontal page in laravel
---

This is a demo page which is is not vertical but horizontal. I think it is funny, because it is not boring up and down.


Maybe the problem with it, you cannot write too much on one page because there is no vertical overflow. But it can be perfect for a small portfolio page.

The menu is just on the main page, if you check it you will see why. But at least this is an unique menu as well. But maybe ugly :D


Ok, I know there is no need the full laravel stuff behind this small website but heey, why not? Laravel is good for everything.
